            <h2>Adoption Process</h2>
            <p>We strive to make the adoption process as smooth as possible for both you and your new pet. Our goal is to ensure that every pet finds a loving home and that every adopter feels confident and prepared for their new family member.</p>
            
            <h2>Steps to Adoption:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Application:</strong> Start by filling out our comprehensive adoption application. This helps us understand your living situation, preferences, and experience with pets. The more information you provide, the better we can match you with a pet that fits your lifestyle.</li>
                <li><strong>Meet and Greet:</strong> After reviewing your application, we will schedule a meet-and-greet with the pet you’re interested in. This is a chance for you to interact with the pet and ensure that you both have a good connection. Our staff will be present to answer any questions and observe the interaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Home Visit:</strong> For certain pets, especially those with specific needs or backgrounds, we may arrange a home visit. This is to ensure that your home is safe and suitable for the pet. It also gives us an opportunity to provide personalized advice on pet-proofing your home.</li>
                <li><strong>Finalize Adoption:</strong> Once everything is in place, you’ll complete the final adoption paperwork and pay the adoption fee. This fee helps us cover the costs of veterinary care and other expenses. We will provide you with all necessary documentation and a care package to help you get started with your new pet.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Additional Information:</strong> After adoption, our support doesn’t end. We offer resources and advice to help you integrate your new pet into your home. Feel free to reach out to us with any questions or concerns. We’re here to assist you every step of the way!</p>
